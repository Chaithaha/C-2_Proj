- [ ] Integrate controllers and services
- [ ] Unify views and navigation

- [ ] Update documentation

See the codebase and Documentation file for more details.

# C-2_Proj

# This is a collaborative project for Back-End 2 - Done by Pallavi, Chait and Dhruv

# The idea is to collaborate our three vastly different projects and compile them into one functioning project.

## Pallavi - A dashboard system to track certain items
## Chait - A GameFinder that that searches and recommends games for you
## Dhruv - A price tracker, that tracks the price of a particular item 

# Our solution - A working platform that lets you find games based on your preferences and then, allows you to track it/s price using our included visual dashbord

## Services Folder
A `Services/` folder will be created for shared business logic and utilities (e.g., price tracking, recommendations, notifications). Place reusable code here as you integrate features from each project.
